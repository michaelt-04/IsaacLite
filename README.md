## Version of Java Used: 21

## IDE used: IntelliJ

## Steps to Import project into IDE:

    1. To import my game into IntelliJ, you first need to clone my repository over to your computer by getting the clone link from GitHub and running the command
    
        git clone [link to repo]
    
    in the terminal in your desired directory. 
    
    2. Once you have the repository on your computer, you can then import it as a project in IntelliJ. To do this you can open another random project, press “Ctrl+Shift+A” on Windows or “Cmd+Shift+A” on MacOS, then search “project from existing source” and click “Import Project from Existing Sources…”. Then you can click the repository you cloned, import it with Gradle, and you should see the project in your IntelliJ.

## Steps to Build Project:

    1. In order to run my game in IntelliJ, you first need to build it by running the build.gradle script, which is in the root folder for the repository. 

    2. Once it is built, you should see a little Gradle logo on the far right of IntelliJ, if you click on it you should be able to see the Gradle tasks.
 
## Steps to run Project:

    1. Pressing this Gradle logo, you can click “Tasks”, then “application” and you'll find the “run” task which will run my game. When you press "run", it should launch the game and you'll see the start screen.
